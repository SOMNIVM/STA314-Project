- We chose 4 models, including logistic regression, vector support machine, decision tree, and random forest for classification problems.
- The first three models were taught in class. 
- The last one is the extension of decision tree. Therefore we also include it after self-studying.

# Feature Selection
- We observed the correlation scatterplot of all the numerical variables 
- The selected numerical variables sleep quality, MMSE, Functional Assessment, and ADL.
